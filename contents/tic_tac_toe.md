In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/tic_tac_toe)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:tic_tac_toe_problem}

In case you wanted to use the same colors as in the gif above, you may find the
[ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)
useful.
