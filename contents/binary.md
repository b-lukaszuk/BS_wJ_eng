# Binary {#sec:binary}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/binary)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:binary_problem}

Numbers, or information in general, can be represented in different forms. The
most basic one, and the only one that is actually understood by a computer, is
represent in a binary form.  Usually, it represented by a sequence of 1s and 0s,
but it could be anything really, that can take two separate states. The once
common [CDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc) or
[DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) are a sequence of laser burns (tiny
pits) in a spiral track (burn - 1, no burn - 0). The [hard disk
drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) stored data as magnetized
spots, whereas [SSD drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)
store data as electrons trapped in tiny transistors. The data can be read into
into memory (RAM) and send to the processor for calculations.

So here is a task for you, read about [binary
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) or watch some online
videos (e.g. from [Khan
Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku4KOFQ-bB4&list=PLS---sZ5WJJvsjaAQZKwTwxl910xUdO98))
on the topic. Next, to get a better grasp of the subject, write:

- a function that transforms a binary number to its decimal counterpart
- a function that transforms a decimal number to its binary counterpart
- a function that adds two binary numbers
- a function that multiplies two binary numbers
