# Stem and Leaf Plot {#sec:stem_and_leaf}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you (you're an adult, right?) go and get it.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) of with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/stem_and_leaf)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:stem_and_leaf_problem}

In statistics a useful technique used to visualize the distribution of data is
[histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). A bit less popular,
although easier to implement with text display is [stem and leaf
plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-and-leaf_display).

So here is a task for you:

- read the Wikipedia's description of how the plot is constructed
- write the function that displays stem and leaf plot for positive integers in the range 0 to 99
- extend it to work also with the range 0 to 999
- extend it to work also with negative numbers in the range -999 to 999
- extend it to work also with floats
