# Leap year {#sec:leap_year}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/leap_year)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:leap_year_problem}

As you probably know an astronomical year is slightly less than 365 days
(roughly 365.25 days). For that reason [the Gregorian
calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) got common years
(365 days each) and a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year).

You task is to write a function that detects whether a given year is leap. Feel
free to test it, e.g. on the following input: [1792, 1859, 1900, 1918, 1974,
1985, 2000, 2012].

## Solution {#sec:leap_year_solution}
