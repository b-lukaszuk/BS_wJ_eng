# Mortgage {#sec:mortgage}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/compound_interest)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:mortgage_problem}

Sooner or later most of us ordinary folk end up taking a mortgage to buy an
apartment or a house.

So here are two scenarios for you:

1. you borrow $200,000 (principal) for 20 years at 6.49% yearly interest rate
2. you borrow $200,000 (principal) for 30 years at 4.99% yearly interest rate

Write a Julia program that will tell you:

1. How much will you pay every month (installment) in both cases (assume fixed
   rate mortgage)?
2. How much principal you will still owe to the bank at year 15 in each
   case?
3. After how many years your debt will be $\le$ $100'000?
4. Which of the two mortgages is more worth it for you (the smaller total cost
   and interest you pay to the bank)?

Feel free to add some visual flair to your solution.

BTW. You may read about mortgages,
e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator#).
