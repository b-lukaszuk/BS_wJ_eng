# Canvas {#sec:canvas}

In this chapter I did not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/canvas)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:canvas_problem}

[terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) graphics. You may,
e.g. draw a house on a meadow, similar to the one below.
