Hello there. This is an open source/access book entitled: "Build SH\*T with
Julia". If anyone asked the full title is "Build **s**uper **h**elpful and
**i**nteresting **t**hings with Julia", but the shorter version fits better on a
page. Anyway, they say that in order to learn any programming language you need
to ~~build sh..~~ write a lot of different programs with it. Therefore,
the book will contain a set of exercises for problems that, for whatever reason,
I found interesting.

This book was generated using [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl)
starting with [BookTemplate](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/BookTemplate).

For now, the book does not have a companion PDF file (probably I will add it
later).

The template for this book can be found
[here](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng) and the code snippets for the
chapters are available
[there](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets).

The book is available freely under [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0
International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. It
was written by a Julia enthusiast for any curious readers, however, it comes
with no warranties whatsoever (see the full license). Still, I wish you a
pleasant and fruitful reading.
