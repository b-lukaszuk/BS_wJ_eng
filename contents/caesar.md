# Caesar {#sec:caesar}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/caesar)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:caesar_problem}

We finished the previous chapter (see @sec:shift_solution) by stating that the
file `trarfvf.txt` contains a text coded with a substitution cipher
with the shift (rotation) of 13 characters. This turns out to be the famous
[Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) used by the famous
Roman emperor in antiquity (breaking the cipher without a computer program and
sufficient amount of text is not an easy task).

So here is a job for you, write a computer program that can code and decode a
textual message with a substitution cipher of any shift. Use it to decrypt the
message contained in `trarfvf.txt` (~31 KiB). Feel free to decipher the file
name (`trarfvf`) itself as well.
