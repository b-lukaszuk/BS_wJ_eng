# Lattice Paths {#sec:lattice_paths}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/lattice_paths)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:lattice_paths_problem}

The following exercise was inspired by [the following Euler
Project problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15), but modified by me.

Take a look at @fig:latticePaths2x2 below. You will find a big square build of
2x2 smaller squares. Your task is to start at the top left corner of the big
square and go to the bottom right corner of it using only right and down arrows.

For the said problem there are exactly 6 paths (as depicted in
@fig:latticePaths2x2). But think about a big square composed of 3x3 little
squares.

How many different paths are there? Can you draw these paths? Well, use Julia to
find out.
