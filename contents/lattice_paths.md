# Lattice Paths {#sec:lattice_paths}

In this chapter I used the following libraries. Still, once you read the problem
description you may decide to do otherwise.

```jl
s24 = """
import CairoMakie as Cmk
"""
sc(s24)
```

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/lattice_paths)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:lattice_paths_problem}

This exercise was inspired by [the following Euler Project
problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15), but it was modified by me.

Take a look at @fig:latticePaths2x2 below. You will find a big square build of
2x2 smaller squares. Your task is to start at the top left corner of the big
square and go to the bottom right corner of it using only right and down arrows
(as few as possible) that span a small square side length.

![Lattice paths on a 2x2 grid.](./images/latticePaths2x2.png){#fig:latticePaths2x2}

For the said problem there are exactly 6 paths (as depicted in
@fig:latticePaths2x2). But think about a big square composed of 3x3 little
squares.

How many different paths are there? Can you draw these paths? Well, use Julia to
find out.

## Solution {#sec:lattice_paths_solution}

[The lattice paths](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15) is actually a problem
from the field of [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics).
In our particular case (3x3 grid) it could be solved (number of paths
calculation) with a Pascal's triangle (covered in @sec:pascals_triangle) or the
build-in `binomial` function (`binomial(nRows+nCols, nRows)`). Since I'm not a
mathematician, then for a detailed explanation I refer you to [this Wikipedia's
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_path#Combinations_and_NE_lattice_paths).

Still, for practical reasons I like to use computer calculations to help me with
my understanding. Let's start small. First, analyze the pictures in
@fig:latticePaths1x1wCoordinates and @fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates.

> **_Note:_** The solution presented here is practical only for small girds (up
> to 4x4 lattice, 70 paths to calculate and to draw). [The original
> problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15) (20x20 grid) got `binomial(40,
> 20)` = `jl binomial(40, 20)` possible routes between the top-left and
> bottom-right corner. That's far too many to calculate with the presented
> method and to draw in one figure.

![Lattice paths on a 1x1 grid in Cartesian coordinate system. Blue lines designate individual small squares.](./images/latticePaths1x1wCoordinates.png){#fig:latticePaths1x1wCoordinates}

![Lattice paths on a 2x2 grid in Cartesian coordinate system. Blue lines designate individual small squares](./images/latticePaths2x2wCoordinates.png){#fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates}

A few points of notice (make sure they agree on both
@fig:latticePaths1x1wCoordinates and @fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates):

1) the top left corner could be considered to be the center of our [Cartesian
coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)
with the location (0, 0);
2) the bottom right corner could be located within that system at the position
(nRows, -nCols) or (nRows, -nRows) of our grid (each small square in
@fig:latticePaths1x1wCoordinates and @fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates got the
side length = 1 and builds rows and columns of a large square);
3) The number of arrows used to reach the destination (the bottom right corner)
is always the same for each path and it is equal to nRows+nCols (or nRows*2);

Equipped with this knowledge, we can finally do something useful.

```
const Pos = Tuple{Int, Int}
const Mov = Tuple{Int, Int}

const RIGHT = (1, 0)
const DOWN = (0, -1)
const MOVES = [RIGHT, DOWN]
const STARTPOINT = (0, 0)

function add(position::Pos, move::Mov)::Pos
    return position .+ move
end

function add(positions::Vec{Pos}, moves::Vec{Mov}=MOVES)::Vec{Pos}
    @assert !isempty(positions) "positions cannot be empty"
    @assert !isempty(moves) "moves cannot be empty"
    result::Vec{Pos} = []
    for p in positions, m in moves
        push!(result, add(p, m))
    end
    return result
end
```

We begin by defining a few constants. The type synonyms: `Pos` (shortcut for
position), `Mov` (shortcut for move) will save us some typing later on.
Whereas, `RIGHT` (shift by 1 unit along X-axis) and `DOWN` (shift by 1 unit
along Y-axis) are the arrow coordinates in the Cartesian coordinate system (it
starts at the top left corner, (0,0), of a big square), which together form a
vector of available `MOVES`.

Next, we define the `add` function. Its first version, aka method, allows to add
a position (like our `STARTPOINT`) to a move (like the move to the `RIGHT`). In
some programming languages we would have to type
something like `return (position[1] + move[1], position[2] + move[2])` but in
Julia we just use a broadcasting operator `.+` to add the tuples
element-wise. The second version of `add` takes a vector of any starting
`positions` and any possible `moves` and adds each move to each starting
position (using simplified nested for loop syntax we met in
@sec:mat_multip_solution) to get the new positions (places on the grid) after
the moves.

Let's put the above functions to good use.

```
function getFinalPositions(nRows::Int)::Vec{Pos}
    @assert 0 < nRows < 5 "nRows must be in the range [1-4]"
    finalPositions::Vec{Pos} = [STARTPOINT] # top left corner
    for _ in 1:(nRows*2) # - *2 - because of columns
        finalPositions = add(finalPositions, MOVES)
    end
    return finalPositions
end

function getNumOfPaths(nRows::Int)::Int
    @assert 0 < nRows < 5 "nRows must be in the range [1-4]"
    target::Pos = (nRows, -nRows) # bottom right corner
    positions::Vec{Pos} = getFinalPositions(nRows)
    return filter(pos -> pos == target, positions) |> length
end

getNumOfPaths(3) # the same result as: binomial(6, 3)
```

```
20
```

`getFinalPositions` accepts `nRows` which is the number of small squares in a
column of, e.g. @fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates. Next, it starts at the top
left corner (`finalPositions::Vec{Pos} = [STARTPOINT]`) and `moves` away from
it. The number of moves is equal to `nRows*2` (see point 3 in the points of
notice above), and we always go in each of both the directions (`RIGHT` and
`DOWN` which are in `moves`) thanks to the previously defined `add`
function. Finally, we `return` the `finalPositions` that we get after we made
all the possible moves. Next, in `getNumOfPaths`, we choose only those
`positions` that land us in the bottom right corner (`target`, see point 2 in
the points of notice above) by using `filter`. The `length` of our vector is the
number of paths we were looking for.

OK, now let's think how to draw it. For once, we could reuse the already written
functions (`add` and `getFinalPositions`) like so (we will modify the functions
a little bit):

```
function makeOneStep(prevPaths::Vec{Path}, moves::Vec{Mov}=MOVES)::Vec{Path}
    @assert !isempty(prevPaths) "prevPaths cannot be empty"
    @assert !isempty(moves) "moves cannot be empty"
    result::Vec{Path} = []
    for path in prevPaths, move in moves
        push!(result, [path..., add(path[end], move)])
    end
    return result
end

function getPaths(nRows::Int)::Vec{Path}
    @assert 0 < nRows < 5 "nRows must be in the range [1-4]"
    target::Pos = (nRows, -nRows) # bottom right corner
    result::Vec{Path} = [[STARTPOINT]] # top left corner
    for _ in 1:(nRows*2) # - *2 - because of columns
        result = makeOneStep(result, MOVES)
    end
    return filter(path -> path[end] == target, result)
end
```

We begin with `makeOneStep` (analogue to `add(positions, moves)`), a function
that makes every possible step (`moves`) from the last known location of every
path in `prevPaths`. BTW, notice how defining the type synonyms paid
off. Without them `Vec{Mov}` would be `Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}` (it isn't all
that bad), but `Vec{Path}` would grow to `Vector{Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}}`,
which is a little monster. Anyway, thanks to the double `for` loop we `add`
every possible `move` (here `RIGHT` or `DOWN`) to the last know location of a
`path` (`path[end]`, which is a `Pos`)) and append it (`push!`) to the `result`
(`path...` copies the previous vector, so `[path..., add(path[end], move)]`
yields the previous `path` with a position after that `move`, e.g. `[(0, 0)]`
becomes `[(0, 0), (1, 0)]`).

Once we know how to `makeOneStep` (remember we test both directions/`moves` at
once, so we branch our paths into two separate paths at each step we take) time
to take `nRows*2` steps (with `for`) and can see which ones will eventually
create the paths that will lead us to our final position (`path[end] ==
target`). As you have guessed this is exactly what `getPaths` does.

Let's see how we did so far (simple minimal test, locate the points depicted
with tuples on @fig:latticePaths1x1wCoordinates).

```
getPaths(1)
```

```
 [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, -1)]
 [(0, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)]
```

I don't know about you, but I'm pretty satisfied with the result.

OK, once we got the path, i.e. the stop points between which we draw the lines,
making a Figure that depicts them should be a breeze.
This could be done with, e.g. CairoMakie's
[arrows2d](https://docs.makie.org/stable/reference/plots/arrows#arrows)
function. However, there's a small problem here, one look at the documentation
and we see that the function requires two arguments, namely `points` (start
points) and `directions` (like `RIGHT` and `DOWN`) and not a `path` which is
starting point, pit stop, pit stop, end point. No biggie, we can get the
directions in no time.

```
function getDirection(p1::Pos, p2::Pos)::Mov
    return p2 .- p1
end

function getDirections(path::Path)::Vec{Mov}
    directions::Vec{Mov} = []
    for i in eachindex(path)[1:end-1]
        push!(directions, getDirection(path[i], path[i+1]))
    end
    return directions
end
```

To `getDirection` we just subtract the position of a previous point on the line
(`p1`) from the position of a next point on it (`p2`). By extension, in
order to `getDirections` we do that for all the points. The last function's body
(`getDirections`) could be also replaced with the following one liner: `return
map(getDirection, path[1:end-1], path[2:end])` (similar to what we did in
@sec:mat_multip_solution). Feel free to choose the version whose meaning is
clearer to you.

Finally, time to draw.

```
function addGrid!(ax::Cmk.Axis,
                  xmin::Int=0, xmax::Int=2, ymin::Int=-2, ymax::Int=0)
    @assert xmin < xmax "xmin must be < xmax"
    @assert ymin < ymax "ymin must be < ymax"
    for yCut in ymin:ymax
        Cmk.lines!(ax, [xmin, xmax], [yCut, yCut], color=:blue, linewidth=1)
    end
    for xCut in xmin:xmax
        Cmk.lines!(ax, [xCut, xCut], [ymin, ymax], color=:blue, linewidth=1)
    end
    return nothing
end

function drawPaths(paths::Vec{Path}, nCols::Int)::Cmk.Figure
    @assert length(paths) % nCols == 0 "length(paths) % nCols is not 0"
    r::Int, c::Int = 1, 1 # r - row, c - column of subFig on Figure
    sp::Flt = 0.5 # extra space on X/Y axis for better outlook
    xmin::Int, xmax::Int = paths[1][1][1], paths[1][end][1]
    ymax::Int, ymin::Int = paths[1][1][2], paths[1][end][2]
    fig::Cmk.Figure = Cmk.Figure()
    for path in paths
        ax = Cmk.Axis(fig[r, c],
                      limits=(xmin-sp, xmax+sp, ymin-sp, ymax+sp),
                      aspect=1, xticklabelsize=10, yticklabelsize=10)
        Cmk.hidespines!(ax)
        Cmk.hidedecorations!(ax)
        directions::Vec{Mov} = getDirections(path)
        points::Vec{Pos} = path[1:end-1]
        addGrid!(ax, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
        Cmk.arrows2d!(ax, points, directions)
        if c == nCols
            r += 1
            c = 1
        else
            c += 1
        end
    end
    Cmk.rowgap!(fig.layout, Cmk.Fixed(1))
    Cmk.colgap!(fig.layout, Cmk.Fixed(1))
    return fig
end
```

We begin with a helper function `addGrid!` that does what it promises (draws
blue lines in sub-figures of our main figure, see
@fig:latticePaths2x2wCoordinates). Then we move to `drawPaths` that draws each
`path` of `paths` (`for path in paths`) on a separate sub-figure (its location
is specified by `fig[r, c]`). A `path` is depicted with a set of arrows
(`arrows2d!`) on the blue grid (`addGrid!`). We hid the Cartesian coordinate
system (`Cmk.hidespines!` and `Cmk.hidedecorations!`) because in the end we
don't care about it that much. Moreover, we narrowed the empty space between the
sub-figures (`Cmk.rowgap!` and `Cmk.colgap!`). The rest of the code in this
snippet is just the necessary, housekeeping that helps us achieve our goal,
which is depicted below.

```
paths = getPaths(3)
drawPaths(paths, 5)
```

All is revealed. Behold the twenty paths on a 3x3 grid.
