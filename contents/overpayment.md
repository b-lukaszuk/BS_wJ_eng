# Overpayment {#sec:overpayment}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/overpayment)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:overpayment_problem}

We finished the previous section (@sec:mortgage) with the discussion about
paying off a mortgage. In general, banks allow their clients to overpay their
mortgages, which should be beneficial to the borrowers. So here is a task for
you.

Write a computer program, that will estimate the savings you make by overpaying
a mortgage (assume an overpayment completely overpays the principal and
reduces the number of installments).

Use the program to answer a few questions.

How much money do you save in the case of `mortgage1` (\$200,000, 6.49%, 20 years) and `mortgage2` (\$200,000, 4.99%, 30 years) (see @sec:mortgage_solution) if you overpay them regularly every month with \$200 dollars.

For the `mortgage1` which one is more worth it: to overpay it every month with
\$200 dollars or to overpay it only once let's say in month 13 with \$20,000?

Which scenario will give you more profit (in nominal value): to overpay `mortgage1` with \$20,000 in month 13, or to put this \$20,000 into a bank deposit that pays 5% yearly for the 19 years (roughly the remaining duration of the mortgage)?
