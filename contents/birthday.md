# Birthday {#sec:birthday}

In this chapter I did not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/birthday)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:birthday_problem}

The following is a classical [birthday
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) problem slightly
modified by me.

Imagine you're throwing a party for your birthday. You invited 4 people.
And now you begin to wonder:

1) what is the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) that any
two of your guests were born on the same day of a year?
2) what is the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) that any
of your guests were born on the same day of a year that you were born on?

Use Julia to answer the before-mentioned questions for the number of guests,
let's say in the range [4-30].
