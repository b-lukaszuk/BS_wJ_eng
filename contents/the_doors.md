# The Doors {#sec:the_doors}

In this chapter I did not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/the_doors)
(without explanations).
