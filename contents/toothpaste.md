# Toothpaste {#sec:toothpaste}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/toothpaste)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:toothpaste_problem}

There is a story (perhaps it is just an urban legend) that in the the 1960s a
toothpaste manufacturer faced a financial crisis. They were desperate to make
the sales go up, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, a guy came by and offered
to increase their sales by at least 50% in exchange for $100'000. At first the
company declined the proposal on account of being to expensive and coming from a
person with no track record. However, after a year the management saw no other
option, but to accept the offer. After all the legal details were set, the guy
spoke only one sentence: "Make the hole bigger".

Try to figure out does making the hole bigger actually moves the sales up by
$\geq$ 50%. Test different scenarios, e.g. different initial hole size, and
see what would have happened if the customers tried to counteract this idea by
squeezing less toothpaste (shorter strip) on the toothbrush.
