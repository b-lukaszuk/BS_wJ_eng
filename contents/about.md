# About {#sec:about}

Hi, I'm Bart and this is my second 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Build SH\*T with Julia".

The book will contain a set of exercises for problems that, for whatever reason,
I found interesting. The tasks will be accompanied by exemplary solutions in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/). Still, I recommend you try to solve the tasks
yourself before checking checking the **code snippets**(TODO link).

For practical reasons, I will assume that book to be read by curious readers
of non-mathematical (i.e. resembling mine) background. Therefore, I expect that
the reader has already mastered the language basics and now are on a lookout for
a way to hone their newly acquired skills. To that end, I'll imagine you have
read [my previous open-access
book](https://b-lukaszuk.github.io/RJ_BS_eng/). I'll do this not not because it
is the best source there is (which it is), but because of the DRY, i.e. don't
repeat yourself, principle (I'm going to apply similar writing conventions
without delving too much into previously mentioned topics).

If, for any reason, you would prefer something else than that book, then feel
free to visit, e.g. Adam Wysokinski's the [Big Book of
Julia](https://adamwysokinski.codeberg.page/bbj/) and choose a resource of your
liking for a start.

Just like previously, I'll try to keep the book possibly simple (clarity over
cleverness and performance) and correct. Still, I'm only human, so watch out for
possible errors and bugs. Anyway, I hope the book will satisfy your appetite, it is
