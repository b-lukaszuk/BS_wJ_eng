# Prime Numbers {#sec:prime_numbers}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you (you're an adult, right?).

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/prime_numbers)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:prime_numbers_problem}

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and
itself. Prime numbers found practical applications, e.g. in cryptography.

In this task your job is to write a function that returns all prime numbers up
to a certain extent. You may use any computational method from [the wikipedia's
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number#Computational_methods)

## Solution {#sec:prime_numbers_solution}
