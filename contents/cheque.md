# Cheque {#sec:cheque}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/cheque)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:cheque_problem}

Every now and then it comes in handy to be able to write down an [English
numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals) with the words. Case in

(perhaps bank) app. So here is a task for you. Write a program in Julia that for
any number, let's say in the range 1 to 999,999 returns its transcription with
words.
