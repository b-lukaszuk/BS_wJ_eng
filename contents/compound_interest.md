# Compound interest {#sec:compound_interest}

In this chapter I will not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

You may compare your own solution with the one in this chapter's text (with
explanations) or with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/compound_interest)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:compound_interest_problem}

There is this cartoon [Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama) that
tells the story of a guy named Fry. The character was accidentally frozen on
December 31, 1999 and wakes up back to life on December 31, 2999. In season 1
episode 6 Fry visits his old bank. The teller informs him that he had on his
account 93 cents in 1999. However, with an average yearly interest of 2.25% over
the period of 1000 years it gives $4.3 billion.

Read about [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest)
and use Julia to answer a few questions.

### Question 1

Is Fry really a billionaire?

### Question 2

According to [this
page](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflacja_w_Polsce#Historia) (careful its in
Polish) the inflation in Poland over the period 2020-2024 was: 3.4%, 5.1%,
14.4%, 11.4%, and 3.6%. If on December 31, 2019 my monthly salary was $10'000 (I
wished) then how much I would have to earn in January 2025 to be able to buy the
same amount of goods like on that date?

### Question 3

Imagine that on January 1, 2020 I opened a bank deposit for 5 years with a
yearly interest rate of 6%. Given the inflation rates from the question 2 would
I make any real profit on January 2, 2025?
