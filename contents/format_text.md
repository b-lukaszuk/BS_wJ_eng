# Format text {#sec:format_text}

In this chapter I used the following libraries. Still, once you read the problem
description you may decide to do otherwise.

```jl
s2 = """
import Random as Rnd
"""
sc(s2)
```

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/format_text)
(without explanations).
