# Touch Typing {#sec:touch_typing}

In this chapter I did not use any external libraries. Still, once you read the
problem description you may decide to do otherwise. In that case don't let me
stop you.

I recommend you try to solve the task on your own first. Once you finish you may
compare your own solution with the one in this chapter (with explanations) or
with [the code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/BS_wJ_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/touch_typing)
(without explanations).

## Problem {#sec:touch_typing_problem}

In this exercise your job is to write a terminal based application, like the one
presented in the GIF below (it doesn't have to be exact), that measures your
(touch) typing speed.

Your program should:

- mark the characters in- and correctly typed
- allow to delete the (incorrectly) typed characters
- display some basic summary of the speed (like WPM - words per minute)

To make it easier, you may assume it to always operate on a short line of text
(let's say 50 characters long) composed only of the characters from the standard
Latin alphabet encoded by [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).
