Hello there. This is an open source/access book entitled: "Build SH*T with
Julia". If anyone asked the full title is "Build *s*uper *h*elpful and
*i*nteresting *t*hings with Julia", but the shorter version fits better on a
page. Anyway, they say that in order to learn any programming language you need
to build a lot of sh**, ekhm, stuff with it. Therefore, the book will contain a
set of exercises (and exemplary solutions) for problems that, for whatever
reason, I found interesting.

This book was generated using [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl)
starting with [BookTemplate](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/BookTemplate).

For now, the book does not have a companion PDF file (probably I will add it later).

The template for this book can be found *here*(TODO) and the code snippets for the chapters are available *there*(TODO).

The book is available under [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0
International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. It
was written by a Julia enthusiast for any curious readers, however, it comes
with no warranties whatsoever (see the full license). Still, I wish you a
pleasant and fruitful reading.
