# About {#sec:about}

Hi, I'm Bart and this is my second 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Build SH*T with Julia".

The book will contain a set of exercises for problems that, for whatever reason,
I found interesting. The tasks will be accompanied by exemplary solutions in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/).

For the practical reasons, I will assume that book to be read by curious readers
of non-mathematical (i.e. resembling mine) background. The readers should have
read [my previous book](https://b-lukaszuk.github.io/RJ_BS_eng/) (or some [other
resource](https://adamwysokinski.codeberg.page/bbj/)) about Julia programming
and now are on a lookout for a way to hone their newly acquired skills.

Just like previously, I try to keep the books possibly simple (clarity over
cleverness) and correct. Still, I'm only human, so watch out for possible errors
and bugs. Anyway, I hope the book will be to your liking, it is available freely
under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0
