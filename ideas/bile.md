# Bile

## Problem

There are different types of nutrients to be found in food but they can be
broadly divided into three categories, sugars (carbohydrates), proteins and fats
(lipids). Your liver produces [bile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile) that is
stored in gallbladder and released to duodenum (part of small intestine). As far
as I remember my biology classes bile facilitates digestion by breaking large
lipid (fat) droplets into smaller. Thanks to that it increases the surface area
in contact with digestive enzymes (lipases). So much for the theory, but I
always wondered if it's true.

Use Julia to demonstrate that total surface area of a few small lipid droplets
is really greater than the surface area of one big droplet. Of course, the big
droplet and small droplets should contain the same volume of lipids.
