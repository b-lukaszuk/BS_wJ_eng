This is an exemplary text2beTyped.	It should be fairly short, let's say up-to 200-500 characters.      It should be composed of standard ASCII charset only.
Usage of different combinations of line lengths, spaces, tabs,      word-lengths shouldn't make much of a difference.      Still, I wouldn't get too creative about this file's contents. Minimal testing
was done on my laptop  running GNU/Linux, so you may have to make some adjustments in the *.jl and this *.txt file to make it work in your case as well.
